                <p>It's why I founded Cupsly in 2022 from my parents' spare room.That opportunity allowed me to enhance my skills and become a better individual. I saw a chance to create something meaningful. Building a business from scratch taught me valuable entrepreneurship, leadership, and problem-solving lessons. I learned how to manage finances, build a team, and create a product people love.

Now, I have the privilege of helping others navigate their challenges and achieve their dreams. It's proof that no matter where you start, with determination, you can turn struggles into success and positively impact the lives of many.

                <p>The Story of Cupsly so far.</p>
                <h2>The Idea</h2>
                <p>
                    It all began in 2022 while standing in my local coffee shop. I've always been a passionate coffee drinker but always left without a non-reusable coffee cup. 

Why? There wasn't a reusable cup that suited my style and aesthetic. Something that was more premium and looked good. So, I decided to create my own statement piece. This was the moment I founded Cupsly.

Think of it more like a fashion accessory.

Something you would be proud to use.

Something you would feel inspired by.

Something you would look good with.

Your aesthetic matched.

                <p>The Making of the Statement</p>
                <h2>Transition</h2>
                <p>
                    After I realised this problem, I reached out to some friends to ask what they thought. While some loved it and some hated it, the more people I asked, the more positive feedback I received. This gave me the confidence to go all in. I met with branding agencies and product designers to create a minimum viable product (MVP). 

During this process, I met Rachael, a friend who had built one of the biggest media agencies in the world. I asked her to help me market this project as I wanted to craft a premium product that would attract the right people. The more we planned the marketing, the more I wanted her to come on board. After six months of conversations, she became my co-founder.
